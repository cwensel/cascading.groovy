Thanks for using Cascading.

General Information:

  Project and contact information: http://www.cascading.org/

  This distribution includes all necessary Cascading libraries, and a simple installer.

  To install, first make sure Groovy is installed, the execute

   $ groovy setup.groovy

  This will copy all libraries to ~/.groovy/lib.

  During runtime, when instantiating cascading.groovy.Cascading(), Hadoop libraries will be registered
  with the Groovy Classloader based on your HADOOP_HOME and HADOOP_CONF.

  See the included samples to get started.
