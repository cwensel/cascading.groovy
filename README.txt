Thanks for using Cascading.

General Information:

  Project and contact information: http://www.cascading.org/

  This distribution includes all necessary Cascading libraries, and a simple installer.

  To install, first make sure Groovy is installed, the execute

    >./setup.groovy

  This will copy all libraries to ~/.groovy/lib, and update ~/.groovy/groovysh.profile.

  One line is added to the bottom of groovysh.profile that will register all Hadoop libraries
  with the shell on startup. For this to work, HADOOP_HOME and optionally HADOOP_CONF must be set.
